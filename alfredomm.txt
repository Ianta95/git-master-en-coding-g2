On buffets
“People do not do well in an unsupervised eating environment. 
Nobody would ever walk into a restaurant and say, ‘I’ll have 
the yogurt parfait, spare rib, meat pie, crab leg, four cookies, 
and an egg white omelet.’ People are building death row, 
last meal wishlists on these plates. It’s like a perfect working 
model for all their emotional problems and personal difficulties. 
They just walk around and they just hold it out, 
‘This is what I’m dealing with…’ It’s a salad with a scoop of 
ice cream on it. I’ve got some unresolved issues I’m trying to work 
out here at the buffet.” Jerry Seinfled.
